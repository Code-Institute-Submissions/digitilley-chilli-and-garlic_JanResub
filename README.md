# <b>Design</b>
- Color Pallete
    - The two main colours used are Onyx and White.
    - I had originally wanted to use Light Coral and White but due a poor 
    accessibility score on Google Lighthouse, I had to change it.
- Typography
    - The Montserrat font is used throughout with Sans-Serif as the backup font.

- Initial Concept
    - The initial concept was designed first to structure the layout of the content and media that was envisaged. 
    - I had originally wanted to create the site with 3 separate pages but unfortunately had to settle on 4 sections due to time constraints.

- <b>The Hero Image</b>
    -   The hero image was selected to break up the blank space and offer something more visual to the user. I added a level of transparancy to ensure the text was fully visible to ensure accessibility for all users was optimised.
